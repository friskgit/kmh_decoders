# Generate ADT decoders


## Scripts for ADT in KMH

These are the scripts used to generate the faust source code using ADT. To use this you need to install ADT and MatLab/Octave.

See the info in the beginning of the Makefile, but basically the order, array and function can be specified in the call to make: `make -k ls function=6 order=3 array=normal`.

The KMHXXX\_AE.m contain the speaker positions.
